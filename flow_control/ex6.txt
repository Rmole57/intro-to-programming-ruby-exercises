Exercise 6

When you run the following code...

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end

equal_to_four(5)

You get the following error message...

exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end

Why do you get this error and how can you fix it?

ANSWER:

You're getting this error message because you forgot an 'end' keyword at the end of your if/else statement. Because of this, your program is treating the 'end' you used for your method definition as the 'end' for your if/else statement and it was still expecting an 'end' keyword to close off your method definition.

You can fix this by putting an 'end' keyword after the 'else' statement, or indenting your current 'end' to make it the end of your if/else statement and adding the final 'end' keyword to your method definition for 'equal_to_four', like so:

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
  end
end

equal_to_four(5)
