Exercise 7 from the 'Hashes' chapter of the book.

QUESTION:

Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

ANSWER:

'my_hash' contains a key-value pair that is the symbol 'x' as the key and 'some value' as the value:
 => {:x=>"some value"}

However, 'my_hash2' contains a key-value pair with the variable 'x', defined as the string "hi there" as the key and 'some value' as the value:
=> {"hi there"=>"some value"}
