What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

ANSWER:

Nothing because there is an explicit return before the 'puts' method is invoked,
meaning Ruby exited the 'scream' method via the 'return' reserved word before 'puts' 
could be called.
