Exercise 1 from 'Loops and Iterators' chapter.

QUESTION:

What does the 'each' method in the following program return after it is finished executing?

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x.each do |a|
  a + 1
end

ANSWER:

=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

It returns this because the 'each' method will always return the original object (in this case, array) that it was called on.
