Exercise 5 from "More Stuff" chapter of the book.

QUESTION:

Why does the following code...

def execute(block)
  block.call
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

Give us the following error when we run it?

block.rb1:in `execute': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)
from test.rb:5:in `<main>'

ANSWER:

This error message occurs because the code never denotes the parameter as a block with '&'. So the method is no longer expecting a block to be passed, rather it's expecting some other type of argument to be passed, which isn't given when the 'execute' method is invoked.
