Exercise 2 from "More Stuff" chapter of the book.

QUESTION:

What will the following program print to the screen? What will it return?

def execute(&block)
  block
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

ANSWER:

The method will print nothing because there was never a 'call' method invoked on the block in the defintion.

The method will return a Proc object.
