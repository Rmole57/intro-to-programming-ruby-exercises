# Exercise 5 of the 'Introduction to Programming with Ruby' book.

arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

# Removes 11 from the end of the array.
# If you wanted to be more specific you could write: arr.delete(11)
arr.pop

# Appends 3 to the array.
# Could also write this as: arr.push(3)
arr << (3)

p arr
